# anagramarama - A simple anagram generator in Go.

This is a simple (and inefficient) anagram generator in Go. Its main purpose
is not to provide a platform for people learning recursive algorithms and
efficiency tweaks in Go.

A few possible improvements:

1. How to make it more efficient in general? Where is time being consumed?
2. How can we make subtract() faster?
3. The anagram() function can be optimized.
4. Make the program UTF-8 safe.
5. Speed up loading by saving a ready made version of wordLetters.

Also, it's quite possible many bug exist.
